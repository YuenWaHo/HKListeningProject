# Welcome to the Hong Kong Listening Project

Welcome to the documentation site for the Hong Kong Listening Project (Echoes of Nature). This project aims to document and study the acoustic biodiversity of Hong Kong through systematic sound recording and analysis.

## Project Overview

The Hong Kong Listening Project is an innovative citizen science initiative that engages undergraduate students in acoustic biodiversity monitoring. Using AudioMoth devices, participants will help create a comprehensive database of Hong Kong's natural soundscapes.

## Key Features

- **Field Research**: Hands-on experience with acoustic monitoring equipment
- **Data Analysis**: Training in bioacoustics analysis and data science
- **Environmental Conservation**: Contributing to biodiversity documentation
- **Skill Development**: Learning research methodologies and scientific documentation

## Getting Started
