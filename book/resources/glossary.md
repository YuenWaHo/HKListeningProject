# Glossary

## A

**Acoustic Index**
: A numerical measure that describes some aspect of an acoustic environment or recording.

**Amplitude**
: The magnitude or loudness of a sound wave.

**AudioMoth**
: An open-source acoustic monitoring device used for environmental recording.

## B

**Bandwidth**
: The range of frequencies present in a sound signal.

**Bioacoustics**
: The study of sound production and reception in animals.

## F

**Frequency**
: The number of sound wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz).

**FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**
: An algorithm that converts time-domain signals to frequency-domain representation.

## H

**Harmonics**
: Integer multiples of a fundamental frequency in a sound.

## N

**Noise**
: Unwanted sound that can interfere with the signal of interest.

## S

**Sample Rate**
: The number of samples taken per second when digitizing audio.

**Spectrogram**
: A visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound over time.

**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**
: The ratio between the desired signal and background noise.

## T

**Time Domain**
: Representation of a signal's amplitude over time.

## W

**Waveform**
: A visual representation of sound showing amplitude changes over time.
